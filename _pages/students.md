Are you a student interested in doing a master thesis on deep learning? Feel free to contact me to discuss potential ideas. I always take time to discuss with students. Some topic suggestions are:

* Federated and decentralized learning
* Out of distribution generalization
* Deep learning for tackling climate change
* Using deep learning to understand social issues
