## About Me

I am an ML Engineer at [eghed](https://eghed.se/), and I was previously an ML Research Scientist at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. My work is centered on representation learning and out-of-distribution generalization in deep neural networks. In 2025, I completed my PhD at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, focusing on [Decentralized deep learning in statistically heterogeneous environments](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1921206/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

I am passionate about leveraging machine learning to tackle pressing challenges in sustainability, climate change, and social justice. I am always open to collaborating on impactful projects in these domains.
