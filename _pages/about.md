I am a machine learning researcher at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and a PhD student in federated learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am part of the [RISE AI deep learning group](http://mogren.one/group/) led by Olof Mogren. [Here is my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=Ft52aSsAAAAJ).

My research is focused on representation learning using deep nets in decentralized and federated systems. I'm especially interested in understanding out of distribution generalization. Beyond this, I have an interest in applying ML to solve problems related to sustainability and climate change.

If you are a student interested in doing a project or a master thesis I am always open for discussions. [Click here](https://edvinli.github.io/students/) for suggestions and previous work I have supervised.
