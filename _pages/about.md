I am a machine learning researcher at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and a PhD student in federated learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am part of the [RISE AI deep learning group](https://mogren.one/group/)led by Olof Mogren.

My research is focused on representation learning using deep nets in decentralized and federated systems. I am also interested in researching continual learning. Beyond this, I have an interest in applying ML to solve problems related to climate change.
