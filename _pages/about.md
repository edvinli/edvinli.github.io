Currently I work as an ML Engineer at [eghed](https://eghed.se/). Previously I was an ML Research Scientist at at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. My research focused on representation learning and out-of-distribution generalization using deep neural networks.

I earned my PhD from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2025 on [Decentralized deep learning in statistically heterogeneous environments](https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1921206/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Beyond this, I am also interested in applying machine learning to address challenges in sustainability, climate change, and social issues. I am always eager to collaborate on projects in these areas.

**Looking for Student Projects?**

I am enthusiastic about mentoring students. If you are interested in project or Master's thesis opportunities, please explore [student project suggestions and previous work](https://edvinli.github.io/students/).  Feel free to reach out to discuss potential collaborations.
